- RSS feed export, in all the native formats supported by Django (Atom, RSS 2.0 and RSS 0.91)
- Data storage in a SQLite database.
- "Nice URLs" support, similar to WordPress.
- Posts can be written using Textile (http://hobix.com/textile/).

This project requires the "textile" egg (install using "easy_install textile") to be used with the 'django.contrib.markup' application.
